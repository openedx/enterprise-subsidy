Subsidy Service signals handler.

The following two scenarios detail what happens when either ECS or a learner initiates unenrollment, and explains how
infinite loops are terminated.

1. When ECS invokes transaction reversal:
=========================================
* Reversal gets created.
  ↳ Emit TRANSACTION_REVERSED signal.
* TRANSACTION_REVERSED triggers the `listen_for_transaction_reversal()` handler.
  ↳ Revoke internal & external fulfillments.
    ↳ Emit LEARNER_CREDIT_COURSE_ENROLLMENT_REVOKED openedx event.
  ↳ Emit LEDGER_TRANSACTION_REVERSED openedx event.
* LEARNER_CREDIT_COURSE_ENROLLMENT_REVOKED triggers the `handle_lc_enrollment_revoked()` handler.
  ↳ Fail first base case (reversal already exists) and quit. <-------THIS TERMINATES THE INFINITE LOOP!
* LEDGER_TRANSACTION_REVERSED triggers the `update_assignment_status_for_reversed_transaction()` handler.
  ↳ Updates any assignments as needed.

2. When a learner invokes unenrollment:
=======================================
* Enterprise app will perform internal fulfillment revocation.
  ↳ Emit LEARNER_CREDIT_COURSE_ENROLLMENT_REVOKED openedx event.
* LEARNER_CREDIT_COURSE_ENROLLMENT_REVOKED triggers the `handle_lc_enrollment_revoked()` handler.
  ↳ Revoke external fulfillments.
  ↳ Create reversal.
    ↳ Emit TRANSACTION_REVERSED signal.
* TRANSACTION_REVERSED triggers the `listen_for_transaction_reversal()` handler.
  ↳ Attempt to idempotently revoke external enrollment (API no-op).
  ↳ Attempt to idempotently revoke internal enrollment (API no-op). <---THIS TERMINATES THE INFINITE LOOP!
  ↳ Emit LEDGER_TRANSACTION_REVERSED openedx event.
* LEDGER_TRANSACTION_REVERSED triggers the `update_assignment_status_for_reversed_transaction()` handler.
  ↳ Updates any assignments as needed.
